Wall Cutter is a foundry vtt module that offers a few new tools that accelerate the creation of walls.

# Tools

The tools are selected from the menu opened by double-clicking a node from a wall.

## Wall Cutting

This is the simplest tool to use. It simply creates a new connection point in the center of the selected wall.
